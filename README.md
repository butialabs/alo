## Alô SDK 📱

You'll need the alo Client SDK on all your pages:

```javascript
import aloClient from 'https://alo-server.xyz/clientSDK';
```

Just drop this in, and you're ready to roll! The SDK gets set up with different options depending on what you want to do with it.

### Automatic Subscription ⚡

This option will show the permission prompt after a short delay - no user clicks needed!

```javascript
const aloConfig = {
    customSegments: {
        tag: 'tag-teste-auto',
        category: 'cat-teste-auto'
    },
    registrationMode: 'auto',  // ← Magic happens here!
    registrationDelay: 3000,   // Just 3 seconds wait
    enableLogging: true,
    onRegistrationSuccess: () => {
        alert('Push notification registration successful!');
    },
    onRegistrationError: (error) => {
        alert('Registration failed: ' + error.message);
    }
};
const aloClient = new aloClient(aloConfig);
```

The secret sauce here is `registrationMode: 'auto'` - this tells alo to automatically ask for permission. You can control how long to wait with the `registrationDelay` setting.

### Manual Subscription 👆

Prefer to let users decide when to subscribe? This approach requires a click before asking for permission.

```javascript
const aloConfig = {
    customSegments: {
        tag: 'tag-test-manual',
        category: 'cat-test-manual'
    },
    registrationMode: 'manual',  // ← User control!
    enableLogging: true
};
const aloClient = new aloClient(aloConfig);

subscribeBtn.addEventListener('click', async () => {
    try {
        await aloClient.subscribe();
        alert('Push notification subscription successful!');
        subscribeBtn.disabled = true;
    } catch (error) {
        alert('Subscription failed: ' + error.message);
    }
});
```

With `registrationMode: 'manual'`, alo waits patiently until you call `subscribe()`. Perfect for adding to a "Subscribe" button!

### Unsubscription 👋

Sometimes users want to say goodbye to notifications. Here's how to let them unsubscribe:

```javascript
const aloConfig = {
    customSegments: {
        tag: 'tag-test-unsubscribe',
        category: 'cat-test-unsubscribe'
    },
    enableLogging: true
};

const aloClient = new aloClient(aloConfig);

unsubscribeBtn.addEventListener('click', async () => {
    try {
        await aloClient.unsubscribe();
        alert('Push notification unsubscription successful!');
        unsubscribeBtn.disabled = true;
    } catch (error) {
        alert('Unsubscription failed:' + error.message);
    }
});
```

Just hook up an "Unsubscribe" button to the `unsubscribe()` method, and you're good to go!

### 🤖 Service Worker

Your notifications need a Service Worker to function even when users aren't on your site:

```javascript
importScripts('https://alo-server.xyz/serviceWorker');
```

Just put this in your `aloSW.js` file, and alo handles all the background notification magic for you! ✨
